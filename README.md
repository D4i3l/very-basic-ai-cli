# A very basic AI CLI app
Written in python using the textual library.

This is my first proper project, so don't expect much from that app...

## Future plans
- [ ] Add chat history
- [ ] Add api key input, so you don't have to insert it into the code
- [ ] Add some colors and life to it

# Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/D4i3l/very-basic-ai-cli.git
cd very-basic-ai-cli
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then you can launch it using

```bash
python main.py
```
