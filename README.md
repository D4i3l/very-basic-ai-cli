# A very basic AI CLI app
Written in python using the textual library.

This is my first proper project, so don't expect much from this app...

## Future plans
- [ ] Add chat history
- [x] Add api key input, so you don't have to insert it into the code
- [ ] Add error handling and loading screens, so the app won't crash/freeze
- [ ] Add some colors and life to it
- [ ] add export chat to markdown

# Installation
**Run these commands:**
```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/D4i3l/very-basic-ai-cli.git
# enter the directory
cd very-basic-ai-cli
#install the dependencies 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then you can launch it using

```bash
python main.py
```
